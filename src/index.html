<h3 class="headline">Four achievements and events from Carl Sagan&#39;s chronicle that are sources of inspiration in my daily life&#58;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Best known for his TV series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, he was, above all, an indefatigable science communicator. His alluring style helped many viewers discover the veiled truths of nature.</li>
<li>Quoting William Poundstone&lpar;author of &quot;Carl Sagan&#58;&nbsp;A Life in the Cosmos&rpar;&#58;&nbsp;&quot;He worked hard for his students so that they got a good job, he cared about their education so that they had a promising future&quot;. 
</li>
<li>He tried to convey a new dimension to the human life on Earth by superbly explaining the insignificance of our evil and ephemeral deeds on a scale of the universe.</li>
<li>During the peak of the Cold War, Sagan focused on promoting nuclear desarmament ideas by exposing the catastrophic effects a nuclear war would unlesh.</li>
</ul> 
<h3 class="headline">His famous quotes evince his approach of critical thinking and skepticism in science as well as his humble human nature. Here are some of my favourites&#58;</h3>
<ul class="quotes">
<li>&#45;For tiny creatures like us the immensity is only bearable through love.</li>
<li>&#45;If you want an apple pie from scrath, first invent the universe.</li>
<li>&#45;The universe is not required to be in harmony with human ambitions</li>
<li>&#45;The brain is like a muscle. When it is used we feel good. Understanding is joy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fun facts&#58;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Did you know that the film <a href="https://movies.fandom.com/wiki/Contact_(film)" target="_blank">&#39;Contact&#39;</a> is based on the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61666.Contact" target="_blank">homonymous novel</a> written by Carl Sagan in 1985?</li>
<li>What is the connection between Stanley Kubrick and Carl Sagan? Surprising question to say the least but I&#39;glad you ask.The answer is that Carl Sagan suggested to insinuate the existence of extraterrestial life instead of explicitly showing it in the film <a href="https://movies.fandom.com/wiki/2001%3A_A_Space_Odyssey" target="_blank">&#39;2001&#58; A Space Odyssey&#39;</a>.</li>
